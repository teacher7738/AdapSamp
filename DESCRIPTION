Description: For distributions whose probability density functions are log-
    concave, Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) algorithm can be used to build for
    sampling. For others, we can use Modifed Adaptive Rejection Sampling (MARS)
    algorithm, Concave-Convex Adaptive Rejection (CCARS) Sampling algorithm and
    Adaptive Slice Sampling (ASS) algorithm  So we designed an R package including
    mainly 4 functions: rARS, rMARS, rCCARS, and rASS. These functions can
    realize sampling based on the algorithms above.
